Worksheet that uses Pandas to Analyze and standardize expenses as exported from the Postepay App. made for my own use

once you have the .csv files save them in the same folder of this scipt.
~~~
Requirements:
jupyter notebook(also collab should be ok)
python 3
Pandas
~~~
spin up the script in jupyter notebook and justrun the files step by step and export the .xsl to be read in excel


## TO Make changes:

read the code and maybe help yourself with pandas cheatsheet https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf 
try to keep variables names clear and maybe prefer verbose over syntethic. you will open this sheet max 1 a month, clear and clean is most important
